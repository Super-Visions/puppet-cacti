Introduction/Notes
==================

This module was created to install and manage Cacti (http://www.cacti.net/)

In it's current form, this module can only suport RedHat based distros.

However as of now it has only been tested on a CentOS 6.2 machine.

Requirements
============
RepoForge repository (http://repoforge.org/)
puppetlabs-apache    (https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache)
puppetlabs-mysql     (https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql)

Installing Cacti
=================
To install cacti simply add "include cacti" to your node.

Managing Devices and Graphs
===========================
You will have to create your own "cacti::implementation" class. Look in the main folder for this node to see an example of what can be done.

Removal of Cacti objects
========================

This module does not have the ability to remove templates, graphs, data sources or devices. This process has to be done manually trough the Cacti interface.
